# Maze
A program using stacks and queues to find your way out of a user-specified maze.

In order to properly implement a maze simulation, the following source code was given by Professor Joanna Klukowska:

Labyrinth - the class that represents a 2D rectangular maze

LabyrinthSearchException - Exception class used by the Simulation program for signaling problems with exploration of the Labyrinth. 

Simulation- the actual program that simulates an exploration of a maze

PossibleLocations - the interface that provides requirements for the stack and queue implementation

Location - the class that represents a position/location of a single square in the maze

SquareType - the enumerated type describing different types of squares in the maze
